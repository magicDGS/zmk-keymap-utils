TODO: intro & overhaul (also maybe move the tip to the configuration part or getting started?)

## Usage

:::tip
We recommend to import the shortcuts before any other behavior, as some of them would use them.
They would be imported by default if not provided.
:::

To use this definitions, source the `shortcuts.h` header:

```c
#include <zmk-keymap-utils/shortcuts.h>
```

## Shortcut defintions

Provided shortcuts include:

<DefinitionTable name="shortcuts" title="Shortcuts"/>

:::danger
The shortcuts might not work as expected if the `&caps_word` behavior is active.
:::

## Modifier definitions

Also some modifier functions are provided:

<DefinitionTable name="modifiers" title="Modifiers"/>

:::caution
The Meh/Hyper related functionality might be available eventually in the zmk project `keys.h`/`modifiers.h` defaults (see [PR#2341](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/pull/2341)).
Future versions of this module would most likely remove these aliases to encourage its use.
:::

Other definitons might be used on different behaviors and are not intended to be consumed by the user.
