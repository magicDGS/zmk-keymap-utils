import BehaviorTable from '../../../components/BehaviorTable.astro';

The `select_word.dtsi` include file provides support for extend/select behaviors for for the specified OS.
They are based on the [Pascal Getreuer's Select Word macro from QMK](https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/select-word/index.html)
implementation for ZMK by [Sunaku](https://github.com/sunaku/glove80-keymaps).

## Usage

:::caution
The `select_word.h` behavior requires includes, if not already sourced, the `shortcuts.h` header.
We recommend to import it beforehand to ensure that the they are always included.
:::

To use the default configuration, import with:

```c
// select-word macros based on the Sunaku's implementation of Pascal Getreuer's Select Word macro from QMK
#include <behaviors/select_word.h>
```

:::danger
Including the `select_word.h` behavior includes also `zmk-helpers` module.
Please, check the [README](https://github.com/urob/zmk-helpers/blob/main/README.md) of the `zmk-helpers` module for more information.
:::

To use a different delay, the `SELECT_WORD_DELAY` property can be used before import (default is `1`).
This configuration defines how long the macro waits (in ms) after moving the cursor before it selects a word.
A larger delay may allow th"macro to move to the next word upon each invocation.
For example:

```c
#define SELECT_WORD_DELAY 50
#include <behaviors/select_word.h>
```

## Behaviors

The behaviors provided after import are the following:

<BehaviorTable name="select_word" />


:::tip
The behaviors are implemented in such a way that using them with the shift modifier active selects/extends in the t
